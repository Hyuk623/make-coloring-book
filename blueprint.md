# Coloring Book Website Blueprint

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a simple web application that allows users to upload an image and convert it into a coloring book page. The conversion process will result in a black outline on a white background, formatted for A4 printing.

## Implemented Features
### Initial Version
- Basic HTML structure (`index.html`)
- Basic CSS styling (`style.css`)
- Basic JavaScript setup (`main.js`)

## Current Plan: Implement Coloring Book Functionality

### Subtasks:
1.  **Set up basic HTML structure:** Add file input, canvas elements for original and processed images, and buttons for convert and print.
2.  **Implement image loading and display:** Read uploaded image file and draw the original image on a canvas.
3.  **Develop image processing logic for outline conversion:** Create functions for grayscale conversion, edge detection, and color inversion (black outlines on white background).
4.  **Integrate A4 sizing:** Set canvas dimensions to A4 aspect ratio and ensure proper scaling for display and printing.
5.  **Implement printing functionality.**
6.  **Refine UI/UX and styling.**
